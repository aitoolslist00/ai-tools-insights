## Performance Commands:

```bash
# Development with Turbo
npm run dev:turbo

# Build with analysis
npm run build:analyze

# Performance testing
npm run lighthouse

# Bundle analysis
npm run bundle-analyzer

# Clean build
npm run clean:all && npm run build
```

## Expected Performance Metrics:

- **Lighthouse Score**: 95+ across all categories
- **LCP**: < 1.5s (target: < 1.0s)
- **FID**: < 50ms (target: < 25ms)
- **CLS**: < 0.05 (target: < 0.02)
- **TTFB**: < 400ms (target: < 200ms)

## Next Steps:

1. Run `npm run build` to test optimizations
2. Run `npm run lighthouse` for performance audit
3. Deploy to Vercel for production testing
4. Monitor real-world performance metrics
