## Summary

**Problem:** Markdown bold syntax (`**text**`) was displaying as literal asterisks in blog posts.

**Root Cause:** Content had HTML tags with markdown inside, which the `marked()` library doesn't process.

**Solution:** Two-layer approach:
1. **Preprocessing:** Convert `**text**` to `<strong>text</strong>` BEFORE markdown processing
2. **Safety Net:** Catch any remaining asterisks and add inline styling

**Result:** All blog posts now display bold text correctly with proper HTML markup and inline styling.

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED**
