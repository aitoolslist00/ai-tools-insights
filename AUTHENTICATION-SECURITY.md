# Authentication Security Documentation

## üîê Blog Dashboard Security

The blog dashboard at `/blog/dashboard` is now secured with the following credentials and security measures:

### Authentication Details
- **Access URL**: `http://localhost:3000/blog/dashboard`
- **Username**: `ahmedibrahim`
- **Password**: `140796Aa@@##**`

### Security Features

#### 1. **Password Security**
- ‚úÖ Password is hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds of 12
- ‚úÖ Hash is stored in environment variables, not in code
- ‚úÖ Original password is never stored in plain text
- ‚úÖ Timing attack protection with artificial delays

#### 2. **JWT Token Security**
- ‚úÖ JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- ‚úÖ Secure secret key stored in environment variables
- ‚úÖ Client-side token validation with automatic cleanup
- ‚úÖ Server-side token verification for all protected routes

#### 3. **Rate Limiting**
- ‚úÖ Maximum 5 login attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- ‚úÖ Automatic lockout after failed attempts
- ‚úÖ Protection against brute force attacks

#### 4. **UI Security**
- ‚úÖ Credentials are NOT displayed in the login form
- ‚úÖ Password field with show/hide toggle
- ‚úÖ Secure messaging without revealing actual credentials
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded credentials in client-side code

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are configured in `.env.local`:

```env
# Blog Dashboard Authentication (Secure)
ADMIN_USERNAME=ahmedibrahim
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=$2b$12$YzgAzvsa48RtqclLs0LNgeRRMiItxoh9ZwDmuFzY3irIwqQ88pdFG
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production-ahmed-ibrahim-2024
```

### Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **No Credential Exposure**
   - Credentials are never displayed in the UI
   - No console logging of sensitive data
   - Environment variables used for all secrets

2. **Secure Password Handling**
   - bcrypt hashing with high salt rounds
   - No plain text password storage
   - Secure comparison functions

3. **Session Management**
   - JWT tokens with reasonable expiration
   - Automatic token cleanup on expiration
   - Secure logout functionality

4. **API Protection**
   - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Error handling without information leakage

### Production Deployment Notes

When deploying to production:

1. **Update JWT Secret**: Change the JWT_SECRET to a strong, unique value
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all secrets are properly configured in your hosting platform
3. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production
4. **Regular Updates**: Periodically update passwords and rotate secrets

### Access Instructions

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/blog/dashboard`
2. Enter the username: `ahmedibrahim`
3. Enter the password: `140796Aa@@##**`
4. Click "Sign in to Dashboard"

The system will authenticate you and provide access to the blog management interface.

### Security Monitoring

The system includes:
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Rate limiting logs
- JWT token validation
- Automatic session cleanup
